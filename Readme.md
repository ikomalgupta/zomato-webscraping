## Project Overview:
In this project, we scrape data from Zomato's website to collect key information on various restaurants. The data gathered includes details like restaurant names, cuisines, prices, ratings, and other metrics essential for analyzing trends and preferences in the food industry.

## Features
Automated Web Scraping: Uses Selenium to navigate and scrape data from Zomato's website.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Handles raw data, dealing with encoding issues and cleaning data for better usability.
Data Storage: Saves extracted data into a CSV file for further analysis.
Analysis-Ready Data: Ensures data is structured and ready for visualization and analysis.

## Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for the entire project.
Selenium: For browser automation and navigating Zomato's website.
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
CSV: Data storage format for easy import into analysis tools.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Selenium
ChromeDriver (or your preferred browser driver)
Pandas

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook file Zomato.ipynb.
Follow the notebook cells to set up the web scraper and run each step in sequence.
The scraped data will be saved as a CSV file in the project directory.

## Challenges
Some challenges faced in this project included:

Encoding Issues: Special characters in restaurant names and prices were cleaned and formatted.
Dynamic Content: Managed scrolling using Selenium to ensure complete data scraping.

## Results
The final dataset contains detailed information on restaurants in the specified location. This data is ready for further analysis, such as examining pricing trends, customer preferences, and identifying popular cuisines.

## Future Work
